1: Verify the effect of creating a replicaset in the pods that are running. Also, what is the effect of scaling the service in the output of your service (e.i. when you curl your serviceâ€™s External IP Address)? Explain why you observe this behavior.


Answer:
	When scaling the service using replicas, we can see that the service is distributed to 3 different pods. Now when you run the command
	curl http://<Your ip-address>
 we can see that our return name changes, choosing between the sets of pods through the loadbalancer.
